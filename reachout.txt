Hello!
Sorry for reaching out in an unusual way, but we didn't manage to find another way to contact you.
I'm working with a company called Rooser (https://www.rooser.eu/).  We were looking to start using GitHub and noticed that account name Rooser was already taken.
Given that this account seems to be pretty inactive, we'd love to discuss if you would be so kind to transfer it to us.

Please contact me via email boris@rooser.co.uk if you are open to discuss it.

Cheers,
Boris.
